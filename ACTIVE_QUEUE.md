# ACTIVE_QUEUE.md

## Queue

Planning snapshot:
- Completed foundation: native editor architecture/buffer/view/input/selection/find plus Ctrl-hold command layer.
- Current near-term lane: finish statusbar/minibuffer, find regression harness, small editing basics, command discovery, config/recent files.
- Later lane: scratch/daily/vault/search/wiki-link/index workflows.

### T001 — Review ThreadSuite generated context

Status: completed
Scope:
- Review inferred Rust/Cargo project context and confirm or edit generated facts.

### T002 — Commandline-first command discovery, with palette as browser

Status: completed
Scope:
- Principle: the commandline is the fastest primary interface; the command palette is for browsing lists of files, commands, settings, and other discoverable collections.
- Done: command-line aliases for save/quit/new/open/preview/wrap/settings/find/goto/delete/select/navigation basics.
- Done: command arguments such as `open ~/notes/todo.md`.
- Done: add live commandline autocomplete: while typing after `Ctrl+.`, show the best matching command completion inline in dim/low-opacity text, terminal-style.
- Done: show a small fzf-like live suggestion list below the commandline when useful, sourced from the real command registry rather than static help text.
- Done: add fuzzy command search instead of substring-only matching for command registry results.
- Done: register command usage from commandline, command palette, shortcuts, and Ctrl-layer where practical.
- Done: persist command history plus recent/frequent command usage in the lightweight config, capped to keep it cheap.
- Done: rank command suggestions with a conservative frequency/recency boost while keeping fuzzy quality primary.
- Done: keep the empty commandline clean; use usage ranking when filtering and in the command palette/browser.
- Keep Slate commandline-first and command-palette-supported: commands before menus/toolbars.

### T003 — Persistent configuration

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Done: lightweight config at `~/.config/slate/config.toml`.
- Done: persist command history limit, command history, line-number mode, word wrap, preview mode, last opened file, recent files, command usage, and Ctrl+Shift movement mode.
- Done: expose persisted wrap/preview controls in Settings and commandline (`:wrap on|off`, `:preview on|off`).
- Done: expose line-number mode through commandline (`:line-numbers absolute|relative`, `:ln absolute|relative`).
- Pending: persist theme, selected vault/notes folder, scratch behavior, wiki-link insert style, and link resolver behavior.
- Keep configuration lightweight and human-readable.
- Add an optional configurable vault/root notes directory for knowledge-management workflows.
- Support toggleable wiki-link styles: compact deep link (`file.md:line:column`) and full Markdown-friendly display link (`file.md:line:column|visible text`).
- Support a future literate Markdown config as the human-facing configuration source.

### T004 — Recent files workflow

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Done: track the last opened file and support `open-last` / `last` / `ol` plus Ctrl-layer `ol`.
- Done: track a real recent opened/saved files list and persist it in config.
- Done: add `:recent` as a commandline-first workflow that opens a live recent-file picker in the minibuffer/palette area.
- Done: support `:recent <query>` and live typing/backspace filtering inside the recent picker.
- Done: add recent command discovery through the live command registry and command palette/minibuffer.
- Pending: optionally reopen the last file at startup.

### T005 — Scratch buffer and quick capture

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Done: preserve existing `slate --scratch` window behavior as a fast capture inbox that appends to `~/.local/share/slate/scratch.md` on exit.
- Done: add `:scratch` / `:sc` command and command-palette entry for an in-app Slate-owned scratch modal.
- Done: scratch modal uses Slate's native `EditorBuffer`/`EditorView`, supports multiline typing, hides with `Esc`, resumes with `:scratch`, and archives with `Ctrl+S`.
- Done: app exit archives pending scratch modal content.
- Done: add `:scratch-entries` / `:scratch-log` / `:scl` modal for reviewing `~/.local/share/slate/scratch.md` as entries.
- Done: from scratch modal, `Ctrl+E` opens scratch entries; in entries, `↑↓` selects and `Ctrl+D` / `Delete` deletes an entry from the archive.
- Done: add `:capture` / `:cap` modal for sending selected text, or current line when no selection exists, to scratch with an optional title/context field focused by default.
- Pending: support daily archive sections and quick append behavior.
- Pending: later promote entries/captures to full notes.

### T006 — Daily notes

Status: pending
Scope:
- Deferred until T018 establishes the optional vault/root folder, so daily notes live in the same knowledge workspace as scratch, captures, links, and future search.
- Add command to create/open today's note.
- Use the configured vault's `daily/` directory and simple Markdown template.
- Preserve the terminal-like, minimal interaction style.
- Consider commands for `daily`, `yesterday`, `tomorrow`, and `append daily`.

### T007 — Core editing improvements

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Done: absolute and relative line-number modes, configurable in Settings.
- Done: `:goto` / `:g` / `:line` / `:l` commands for absolute jumps and explicit `+/-` relative jumps.
- Done: delete line, select line, select word, delete word, top, and bottom commands.
- Done: track and display current line/column in the statusbar.
- Done: move current line up/down commands and `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down` shortcuts.
- Done: Alt structural vertical batch for current-line movement and paragraph-boundary movement.
- Done: duplicate line command.
- Continue adding useful Vim-inspired text operations without requiring a full Vim mode.

### T008 — Lightweight Markdown improvements

Status: pending
Scope:
- Improve preview rendering without making Slate heavy.
- Support checklists, blockquotes, separators, local links, better code blocks, and simple tables where practical.
- Keep Markdown as plain files plus lightweight conventions, not a custom database format.

### T009 — Theme system

Status: pending
Scope:
- Formalize current theme as terminal-dark.
- Add alternate themes such as nord, amber-terminal, green-phosphor, and blueprint.
- Add theme selection via command palette and persist the choice.

### T010 — Minimal file explorer / project file opening

Status: completed
Scope:
- Add a command-palette-first file opener for a directory/project.
- Search files by name without adding a heavy sidebar.
- Keep the UI minimal: no menubar, no toolbar.
- Superseded by T047: the regular Slate-owned `Open` modal now covers project/repo file opening with focused fuzzy input, large result list, keyboard navigation, and project-root start.
- Removed the redundant `:files` / `:file` / `:open-file` / `:of` command path and `Ctrl+Alt+O` shortcut because `Ctrl+O` already opens the same project-root modal.
- Done: skips heavyweight/generated directories such as `.git`, `target`, `node_modules`, and `.threadwell`.
- Done: file results show lightweight metadata columns for size and relative modified time.

### T011 — Buffers / multi-file workflow

Status: pending
Scope:
- Support multiple open buffers.
- Add switch-buffer and close-buffer commands.
- Prefer command-palette-driven buffers before visible tabs.
- Borrow the useful Emacs concept of buffers without adopting Emacs complexity.

### T012 — Optional auto-save

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add configurable auto-save for suitable workflows.
- Consider save-on-focus-loss or timed auto-save.
- Keep auto-save especially useful for scratch and daily notes.

### T013 — Terminal/Vim-like command language

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Done: command line supports `save`, `quit`, `wq`, `new`, `open`, `wrap`, `preview`, `find`, `goto`, `settings`, and early edit/navigation commands.
- Done: common aliases such as `:w`, `:q`, `:wq`, `:x`, `:e`, `:f`, `:g`, `:dl`, `:dw`, `:sw`, `:sl`, `:gt`, `:gb`.
- Done: make the command list a live registry used by commandline autocomplete, fzf-like suggestions, palette results, aliases, and command palette entries.
- Done: route command palette results through the shared command registry and fuzzy matching.
- Pending: add knowledge commands like `:daily`, `:scratch`, and `:theme amber`.

### T014 — Templates

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add templates for daily notes, meetings, projects, ideas, and journaling.
- Add `New from template` through the command palette.
- Keep templates as editable plain text/Markdown files where possible.

### T015 — Task/checklist commands

Status: pending
Scope:
- Detect Markdown task lines like `- [ ]` and `- [x]`.
- Add command to toggle the current task.
- Later consider listing tasks from the current file or notes folder.
- Consider archiving completed tasks without creating a full productivity system.

### T016 — Richer status bar and command line layout

Status: completed
Scope:
- Done: statusbar shows file path/name, modified state, status message, active mode, wrap state, cursor line/column, line count, word count, char count, and shortcut hint.
- Done: statusbar sits above a dedicated command line/minibuffer.
- Done: command history, Ctrl-layer, command entry, and search use the bottom/minibuffer region without overlaying the editor.
- Done: Ctrl+H shortcut help moved from the crowded minibuffer list into its own modal with shortcuts plus registered commands.
- Done: commandline inactive hint points to command entry, help, and palette.
- Future modes such as link resolver, recent picker, file opener, and textual result buffers should reuse this statusbar/minibuffer pattern.
- Keep the visual style terminal-like: status line plus command line, similar to Vim/Emacs minibuffer concepts.

### T017 — Slate knowledge-work philosophy

Status: completed
Scope:
- Done: added `PHILOSOPHY.md` as Slate's product/design charter.
- Done: defined Slate as a personal text workspace / terminal-like knowledge editor, not an Obsidian/Logseq clone.
- Done: prioritized local files, capture first, commands before UI, progressive organization, and simple Markdown.
- Done: explicitly documented anti-goals: early graph views, mandatory databases, heavy sidebars, plugin complexity, sync systems, and Emacs-level configurability.
- Done: added feature decision rules for future scratch/daily/vault/wiki-link/index work.

### T018 — Optional vault / local knowledge base

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Do before T006 Daily Notes so scratch, captures, daily notes, links, and future search share one optional knowledge root.
- Done: add contextual command availability so setup commands can appear before a vault exists and vault-only commands can appear after configuration.
- Done: add `:vault-set` / `:vault` command that opens a Slate-owned folder picker for selecting a normal folder as Slate's optional knowledge workspace.
- Done: initialize selected vault folders/files: `scratch.md`, `daily/`, `ideas/`, `projects/`, and `README.md`.
- Done: support creating a new vault folder from the `:vault-set` modal with `Ctrl+N` / `+ new folder`, using a small name modal; Enter creates and enters the folder, then Enter again selects it as the vault.
- Done: persist the configured vault in `~/.config/slate/config.toml`.
- Done: add `:vault-open` / `:open-vault` and `:vault-status` / `:vault-info` commands once a vault is configured.
- Keep Slate usable as a regular text editor even when no vault is selected.
- Treat the configured vault as the root for scratch, daily notes, ideas, projects, wiki links, and search.
- Use normal folders/files such as `daily/`, `scratch.md`, `ideas/`, and `projects/`.
- Migrate/redirect future scratch and capture storage to `vault/scratch.md` when a vault exists, while preserving the current data-dir fallback when no vault is configured.
- Add lightweight commands/status for showing and opening the current vault root.
- Leave indexing/SQLite for T023 after the filesystem layout is stable.

### T019 — Wiki links and note navigation

Status: pending
Scope:
- Support simple wiki links like `[[Slate roadmap]]` in Markdown text.
- Support deep wiki links to exact positions: `[[path/file.md:line:column]]`.
- Support full display links for readability: `[[path/file.md:line:column|visible text]]`.
- Add a toggle/preference for compact links vs full display links.
- Add command to open/create the note under cursor or selected wiki link.
- Add shortcut to follow link under cursor and jump to target file/line/column.
- Later support backlinks without requiring a graph view or database-heavy model.

### T020 — Global notes search

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add text search across the configured notes directory.
- Search by note/file name, content, tags, and later backlinks.
- Prefer search results in the command palette or a minimal modal.
- Reuse the same search/index primitives for the `[[` link resolver.

### T021 — Progressive organization commands

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add commands to move selection/current line to a new note, append to daily note, append to scratch, convert line to task, and archive completed tasks.
- Support commands that both edit the current text and append/capture a copy elsewhere.
- Support the workflow: write first, organize later.

### T022 — Tags and lightweight metadata

Status: pending
Scope:
- Support simple inline tags like `#idea`, `#project`, and `#todo`.
- Search/filter notes by tags.
- Avoid complex frontmatter requirements unless clearly useful.

### T023 — Vault index architecture: Markdown source plus rebuildable SQLite cache

Status: pending
Scope:
- Keep Markdown files as the source of truth.
- Use SQLite only as an optional/rebuildable index/cache for search, links, backlinks, tags, tasks, and recent/frequent results.
- Evaluate SQLite FTS5 for fast content search and snippets.
- Ensure Slate can delete/rebuild the index from the vault at any time.
- Do not store canonical note content only inside SQLite.

### T024 — Link resolver trigger for `[[`

Status: pending
Scope:
- Detect when the user types `[[` in the editor.
- Open an inline fzf-like resolver/modal without disrupting normal writing.
- Keep filtering live as the user types inside the unfinished link.
- Support Escape to cancel and Enter to insert the selected result.
- Make the resolver available as a command too, not only through automatic trigger.

### T025 — Link resolver ranking and result groups

Status: pending
Scope:
- Merge multiple result types into one selector: most-linked notes, recent notes, filename/title matches, content matches, tag matches, and create-new-note action.
- Rank filename/title matches above content matches when both are strong.
- Show content matches with snippet, file path, line, and column.
- Highlight matched query text in results where practical.
- Prefer deterministic ordering when scores tie.

### T026 — Content-match deep link insertion

Status: pending
Scope:
- When selecting a filename/title result, insert a normal wiki link such as `[[path/file.md]]` or `[[Note title]]`.
- When selecting a content result, insert a deep link to exact position.
- Support compact style: `[[path/file.md:line:column]]`.
- Support full style: `[[path/file.md:line:column|visible text]]`.
- Choose visible text from matched word, selected snippet, note title, or user-edited label depending on context.

### T027 — Wiki-link parser and target resolver

Status: pending
Scope:
- Parse wiki links robustly: `[[Note]]`, `[[path/file.md]]`, `[[path/file.md:line]]`, `[[path/file.md:line:column]]`, and `[[path/file.md:line:column|label]]`.
- Resolve note titles and relative paths inside the selected vault.
- Safely handle spaces, punctuation, duplicate titles, missing files, and renamed/moved notes.
- Define behavior for links outside the vault or when no vault is selected.

### T028 — Follow-link navigation and cursor jump

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add shortcut such as Ctrl+Enter to follow the wiki link under cursor.
- Open the target file and jump to the target line/column when present.
- If target file does not exist, offer to create it in the vault.
- Preserve current buffer state and dirty checks when navigating.
- Later integrate with buffer history/back navigation.

### T029 — Link display ergonomics and visual affordances

Status: pending
Scope:
- Keep plain Markdown text editable and readable.
- Optionally provide subtle highlighting for wiki links in the editor/preview.
- Avoid making long deep links annoying in prose by supporting full display links.
- Add commands/toggles to convert compact links to full links and full links to compact links.
- Consider a statusbar/tooltip preview of the real target when cursor is on a link.

### T030 — Backlinks and most-linked notes

Status: pending
Scope:
- Track wiki-link references across the vault through the index.
- Use backlink counts to power the resolver's `most linked` group.
- Add command to show backlinks for the current note.
- Avoid graph-view-first UX; backlinks should be textual/searchable first.

### T031 — Link resolver performance and indexing lifecycle

Status: pending
Scope:
- Start with simple filesystem scanning if needed, then move to SQLite/FTS when vault size demands it.
- Incrementally update the index when files are opened/saved/changed.
- Provide manual `Rebuild vault index` command.
- Keep resolver responsive for large vaults by limiting result counts and doing expensive work off the UI path where possible.

### T032 — Soft Vim-inspired editing grammar

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Done: first transient grammar exists through Ctrl-hold release dispatch.
- Done: `dl`, `dw`, `sw`, `sl`, `gt`, `gb`, `ol`, and shortcut help are implemented.
- Done: Ctrl+Shift live navigation supports configurable Vim `h/j/k/l` or Slate `i/j/k/l` movement.
- Pending: future operator-style commands such as change word, change inside quotes/parens, and jump by word/paragraph.
- Avoid requiring constant mode toggling; prefer transient command capture, command palette actions, or leader/chord-style interactions.
- Keep normal typing as the default behavior.
- Make commands discoverable and configurable before expanding too far.

### T033 — Ctrl-hold command layer

Status: completed
Scope:
- Done: Ctrl is a physical temporary command layer that collects key sequences while held and dispatches on Ctrl release.
- Done: single-key Ctrl commands remain available on release: `s`, `o`, `n`, `p`, `q`, `m`, `.`, `f`, `b` in find context.
- Done: multi-key commands: `dl` delete line, `dw` delete word, `sw` select word, `sl` select line, `ol` open last, `gt` go top, `gb` go bottom.
- Done: `h` opens a dedicated shortcut/command help modal.
- Done: pending Ctrl sequence is shown in the dedicated command line while Ctrl is held.
- Done: Ctrl+Shift live navigation moves immediately without waiting for release.
- Done: movement mode is configurable in settings: Vim `h/j/k/l` or Slate `i/j/k/l` (`i` up, `j` left, `k` down, `l` right).
- Future expansion belongs in T032/T046 rather than keeping this task open.

### T034 — Repeatable edits and lightweight macros

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add repeat-last-edit behavior inspired by Vim's `.` command.
- Consider recording/replaying a short sequence of editor operations later.
- Keep this lightweight and optional; do not implement a full macro language early.
- Ensure repeated commands work with Slate-native operations such as append-to-scratch/daily and task toggles where sensible.

### T035 — Append/capture side effects from normal editing

Status: pending
Scope:
- Add commands that insert or transform text in the current buffer while also appending/capturing related content elsewhere.
- Examples: insert a note link and append context to scratch; create task here and append to daily; mark an idea inline and append it to `ideas/inbox.md`; create a new note from selection while replacing selection with a wiki link.
- Make side effects explicit, previewable, and undo-safe where possible.
- Prefer vault-relative plain Markdown targets.

### T036 — Textual result buffers

Status: pending
Scope:
- Borrow Emacs' useful concept that tool outputs can be buffers.
- Show search results, backlinks, task lists, command output, and index diagnostics as navigable text-like buffers or minimal panels.
- Allow opening/jumping from result entries with keyboard shortcuts.
- Keep these buffers optional and command-driven, not permanent UI clutter.

### T037 — Curated defaults instead of infinite configurability

Status: pending
Scope:
- Borrow Doom Emacs' concept of curated power: strong defaults, coherent aesthetics, and discoverability.
- Avoid exposing every internal behavior as a setting too early.
- Add configuration only when it protects distinct workflows, such as compact/full links or vault location.
- Keep Slate powerful but not life-consuming.

### T038 — Literate Markdown configuration

Status: pending
Scope:
- Support a Markdown configuration document where prose explains the config and fenced config blocks define the actual settings.
- Prefer TOML blocks inside Markdown, such as code fences tagged `toml slate-config` or `slate-config`.
- Treat the Markdown config as the human-facing source and optionally generate/cache a machine-readable `config.toml` from it.
- Add commands such as `Open Slate config`, `Reload Slate config`, `Validate Slate config`, and later `Tangle Slate config`.
- Show validation/tangle errors in a textual result buffer.
- Keep config documentation close to the actual settings so the config file becomes self-documenting.
- Ensure normal plain config still works for users who do not want literate configuration.

### T039 — Native editor architecture: leave `egui::TextEdit` behind

Status: completed
Scope:
- Replace the main editing surface architecture from `String + egui::TextEdit` to Slate-owned editor primitives.
- Keep `egui::TextEdit` only for small inputs such as command line, palette, and settings fields.
- Do not attempt search/highlight/scroll features on top of `TextEdit`; build them on Slate-owned buffer/view state.
- Preserve current normal-editor behavior during migration: typing, saving, opening, wrapping, preview toggle, command line, status bar, and scratch behavior.
- Treat this as prerequisite infrastructure for reliable find, selections, cursor jumps, link following, and future editing grammar.

### T040 — EditorBuffer text model

Status: completed
Scope:
- Introduce an `EditorBuffer` that owns text, dirty state inputs, cursor byte/char position, optional selection, revision counter, and line index.
- Maintain `line_starts` or equivalent for efficient byte offset ↔ line/column conversion.
- Implement minimal mutation primitives: insert text, newline, backspace, delete, replace selection, set cursor, set selection, clear selection.
- Rebuild/update indexes safely after edits and file open/new buffer.
- Add focused unit tests for line indexing, Unicode-safe cursor movement where practical, insertion, deletion, and offset conversions.
- Initially allow Slate to still render through `TextEdit` only if useful for a staged migration, but keep mutation logic in the buffer.

### T041 — Native EditorView renderer

Status: completed
Scope:
- Build an egui-based custom editor view that paints visible lines with `Painter` instead of delegating the document to `TextEdit`.
- Track viewport/scroll state, line height, first visible line, visible line count, cursor rectangle, and selection rectangles.
- Render only visible lines for responsiveness on large files.
- Paint cursor, current line, selection, and later search/link highlights from explicit ranges.
- Support word wrap later; start with reliable no-wrap or simple wrap if needed.
- Keep the status bar and command line layout unchanged: editor area should shrink upward when bottom panels are visible.

### T042 — Native editor input handling

Status: completed
Scope:
- Route text input and keyboard events into `EditorBuffer` when the editor has focus.
- Implement minimum viable normal editing: character input, Enter, Backspace, Delete, Arrow keys, Home/End, PageUp/PageDown, mouse click to place cursor, and scroll wheel.
- Preserve existing global shortcuts such as Ctrl+S, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+M, and Ctrl+.
- Avoid stealing OS/window-manager shortcuts such as Ctrl+Shift+S.
- Make focus transitions explicit between editor, command line, palette, settings, and future search mode.
- Add tests for buffer operations; manually validate GUI event behavior after changes.

### T043 — Native selection, cursor jump, and scroll-to-position

Status: completed
Scope:
- Support explicit cursor movement to byte offset or line/column.
- Support programmatic selection ranges independent of command line focus.
- Implement `scroll_to_cursor` / `scroll_to_line` so commands can jump to results reliably.
- Keep selection visible even when command line or a panel has focus where appropriate.
- Use this for future find results, wiki-link follow, backlinks, task result buffers, and command outputs.

### T044 — Search/find on native editor primitives

Status: completed
Scope:
- Reintroduce find only after `EditorBuffer`, `EditorView`, cursor jump, selection, and scroll-to-position exist.
- Use command line/minibuffer as the search input: Ctrl+F opens `find `; `:find query` and `:f query` are supported.
- Keep live search as `SearchState` over `EditorBuffer`, cache by buffer revision and query, and never recompute unnecessarily per frame.
- Start with exact case-insensitive search; later evaluate a real matcher such as `nucleo-matcher` for fzf-like ranking.
- Render highlights only through the native editor view and only for visible ranges.
- Support `f`/`b` to move selected result, Enter to accept, Escape to cancel, and status text such as `match 2/10`.
- Support `Ctrl+F` / `Ctrl+B` while find is active to place the cursor after/before the current match without reopening find.
- Add regression tests for search matching behavior, including one-line-many-matches and single-letter queries.

### T045 — Find fixture and regression harness

Status: completed
Scope:
- Done: `test-fixtures/lorem-find.md` is both a manual and automated fixture for search behavior.
- Done: fixture covers repeated words, case-insensitive matches, no-match query, single-letter queries, Unicode-adjacent matches, stable markers, and noisy/large-ish text.
- Done: unit tests validate fixture match counts, search result offsets, and line/column mapping through `EditorBuffer`.
- Done: lightweight performance smoke test guards common one-letter queries against obvious regressions.

### T046 — Pragmatic command backlog: useful basics without becoming Vim

Status: in_progress
Scope:
- Treat this as a curated backlog, not an instruction to implement every command immediately.
- Prefer commands that map to clear editor operations and can be reused later by command palette, command line, Ctrl-hold grammar, and Alt structural editing.
- Keep normal typing as the default; avoid a permanent Vim mode.
- Treat Ctrl+Shift as live cursor movement, Ctrl-hold as command dispatch, and Alt as a structural text/line manipulation layer.

### T047 — Slate-owned file dialogs for open/save/save-as

Status: completed
Scope:
- Done: replaced native Linux/desktop dialogs from `rfd` with Slate-owned egui modals so file workflows match the terminal-like UI.
- Done: evolved the T010 project file picker for `Open`: `Ctrl+O`, Ctrl-layer `o`, and bare `:open` open Slate's modal; `:open path` / `:e path` still open directly.
- Done: every Slate-owned filesystem modal supports consistent arrow navigation: `↑↓` selects entries, `→` enters the selected directory when selection is a folder, and `←` goes back to the parent directory.
- Done: Open/SaveAs filesystem modals show both directories and files, with clear folder/file affordances, while preserving fuzzy filtering and metadata where useful.
- Done: added a Slate `Save As` modal with a focused path input, clear title, `Enter` to save, and `Esc` to cancel.
- Done: added `Ctrl+Alt+S` as the Save As shortcut while preserving `Ctrl+Shift+S` for the OS/window manager.
- Done: `Save` remains direct when the buffer already has a path; scratch/untitled buffers open the Slate `Save As` modal.
- Done: preserved unsaved-change confirmation flows before opening/replacing buffers.
- Done: removed the `rfd` dependency from `Cargo.toml`.

### Three-batch Alt structural editing plan

Batch 1 — Vertical line movement: done.
- Done: add `EditorBuffer` primitives to move the current line up/down one line.
- Done: add paragraph-boundary primitives to move the current line to the start/end of its paragraph, where a paragraph is a contiguous block of non-empty lines separated by blank lines.
- Done: add commandline commands: `:move-line-up` / `:mlu`, `:move-line-down` / `:mld`, `:move-line-to-paragraph-start` / `:mlps`, `:move-line-to-paragraph-end` / `:mlpe`.
- Done: add shortcuts: `Alt+Up` and `Alt+Down` for one-line movement.
- Done: add Alt structural mode mappings:
  - Slate mode: `Alt+i` move line up, repeated `Alt+ii` move line to paragraph start; `Alt+k` move line down, repeated `Alt+kk` move line to paragraph end.
  - Vim mode: `Alt+k` move line up, repeated `Alt+kk` move line to paragraph start; `Alt+j` move line down, repeated `Alt+jj` move line to paragraph end.
- Done: show the pending Alt sequence in the minibuffer as `alt:i`, `alt:ii`, etc.
- Done: keep this current-line only; selected-line ranges are a future extension.

Batch 2 — Horizontal word selection: done.
- Done: add `EditorBuffer` primitives to select/extend by words to the left and right.
- Done: Alt structural left key selects the word under/near the cursor and leaves the cursor at the left edge; repeated taps extend selection one more word left each time.
- Done: Alt structural right key selects the word under/near the cursor and leaves the cursor at the right edge; repeated taps extend selection one more word right each time.
- Done: Slate mode: `Alt+j` extends word selection left; `Alt+l` extends word selection right.
- Done: Vim mode: `Alt+h` extends word selection left; `Alt+l` extends word selection right.
- Done: preserve normal typing and avoid permanent modes.

Batch 3 — Duplicate line and polish: done.
- Done: add `EditorBuffer::duplicate_current_line()` with tests.
- Done: add `:duplicate-line` / `:dup`.
- Done: keep duplicate line out of Alt; expose it through commandline and Ctrl-layer `dup` so Alt stays structural movement/selection.
- Done: update shortcut help, README, and queue docs with the final Alt structural layer.
- Done: add regression tests for line movement at first/last line, paragraph boundaries, Unicode lines, selection extension, and duplicate-line behavior.

Follow-up — Duplicate placement transient mode: done.
- Done: keep simple `:dup` stable.
- Done: add transient duplicate-placement mode as `:duplicate-place` / `:dupp`.
- Done: duplicate current line, mark the duplicate as active, move it up/down while the transient mode is active, then confirm with `Enter`/`Space` or cancel with `Esc`.
- Done: reuse Slate/Vim `Ctrl+Shift` movement mapping plus arrow movement while placement is active.
- Done: show status/minibuffer help such as `duplicate placement: move · Enter/Space place · Esc cancel`.
